    "Except for billionaires and millionaires, every family or individual must budget for their daily existence. Our expenditures must be commensurate with our incomes. Wants are unlimited while resources are limited. Each family has their own priorities. Expenditures on food, clothing and accommodation consume most of a family s income. Of whatever little remains, some want to spend on upgrading their capabilities/skills to enjoy a better tomorrow, while others want to spend on pomp and pleasure. It's nobody s business to pass comments on the conduct of any individual. However, when it comes to a family or a nation, the choices must be made in consideration of the overall benefits and priorities of its members. Budgeting, in a sense, reflects our priorities or strategies towards the pursuit of happiness.",
